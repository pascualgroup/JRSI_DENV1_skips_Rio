See the Rmarkdown file Model_Implementation.Rmd (or the HTML file Model_Implementation.HTML)
in the Code folder which contains code used to implement the stochastic SIR cosine model and generate the principal figures of the manuscript. 

The file 'denguerj1986-1996.RData' in the folder Down_Data/ contains the raw dengue case data used for this analysis.


Additional supporitng code is provided in the Code/ folder. 

The principal and  supporting figures can be found the Figures/ folder.

Numerical output obtained from fitting of the stochastic model can be found in the Generated_Data/ folder.
